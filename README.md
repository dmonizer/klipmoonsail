# klipmoonsail

intended to build and run dockerized klipper, moonraker and moonsail on raspi (which has direct usb connection to your 3d printer).

1) edit buildstart.sh script and make sure mainsail version is correct
2) put your klipper config to runtime/config as printer.cfg (beware of resent changes in klipper, which renders all old menu customizations broken). There is sample config file for AnetA8 included for reference if needed.
3) run ```./buildstart.sh init``` which will clone klipper and moonraker and download mainsail release, build docker images and run klipper for the first time interactively, so you can configure and flash the printer according to klipper docs (up to flashing)
4) run ```buildstart.sh run``` to run 

now klipper, moonraker and mainsail are running in docker (hopefully) and you can connect to your raspi:8080 with web browser.

to stop, use "./buildstart.sh stop"
to restart, "./buildstart.sh restart"

issues, PRs, stars :) welcome.
